**Part 1:**
1. Program a super simple “Hello World” smart contract: store an unsigned integer and then retrieve it. 
2. On the documentation page, the “Ballot” contract  demonstrates a lot of features on Solidity. Read through the script and try to understand what each line of code is doing, then implement the Possible Improvements by reducing the number of transactions in the “**giveRightToVote**” function while maintaining the same functionality of the program.
